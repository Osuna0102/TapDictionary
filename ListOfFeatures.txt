List of future features:

- Drastically improve the app UI/UX to make it more user friendly, modern and appealing. Use modern design principles, keeping it simple and easy to use.

- If no entry found, default to a NO KEY API call to a 3rd party translation service to get a translation of the word selected.
- Add the app ON/OFF button to the notification bar for easier access. (not only accessibility settings).


- The lenguage options should be parametrizable in the settings (For example, yomitan uses for spanish: 
Recommendations
    Setting scanning.scanResolution = "word"
    Scan text one word at a time (as opposed to one character).

    Setting translation.searchResolution = "word"
    Lookup whole words in the dictionary.

    Setting parsing.enableScanningParser = false
    Turn off Yomitan's internal parser for languages with spaces.
And for japanese:
    Recommendations
    Setting scanning.scanResolution = "character"
    Scan text one character at a time.

    Setting translation.searchResolution = "letter"
    Lookup words by letter in the dictionary.



- Add support for phrases (2-3 words) in addition to single words. (FOR LATIN-LIKE LENGUAGES, AS THEY USE WORD SEPARATED BY SPACES).
- Add ADS support for monetization, if payed version not purchased.
- If possible (look at accessibility settings limitation), add text-to-speech support for both source and target languages.
- Add a "personal data" section where words looked up are stored locally for review later, with a counter if the word is repeated (looked up 2+ times)
- If possible (look at accessibility settings limitation), add a color highlight feature for words on the screen based on the personal data. If NOT looked up ever, show RED. if already looked up 5+ then blue. 10+ green, etc.
- Add support for multiple different apps like whatsapp, discord, etc. They should be able to be deactivated.
