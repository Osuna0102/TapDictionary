---

### PREMIUM TIER (One-Time Purchase)

---

### ALTERNATIVE MODEL: **SUBSCRIPTION** (Consider for Year 2)

**If you want recurring revenue:**

**TapDictionary Pro** - $1.99/month or $14.99/year (save 38%)

**Pros:**
- Recurring revenue (more predictable income)
- Lower barrier to entry ($1.99 vs $4.99)
- Justifies ongoing feature development

**Cons:**
- Subscription fatigue (users hate monthly payments)
- Higher churn rate
- Requires constant new features to retain subscribers

**Verdict:** Start with one-time purchase, test subscription in 6 months

---

### REVENUE PROJECTIONS (Conservative Estimates)

**Assumptions:**
- 10,000 downloads in first 3 months (organic + ASO)
- 2% conversion to Pro (industry standard for freemium education apps)
- $4.99 price point
- 30% Google Play fee

**Month 1:**
- Downloads: 1,000
- Pro purchases: 20 (2%)
- Revenue: 20 × $4.99 × 0.70 = **$69.86**

**Month 3:**
- Downloads: 5,000
- Pro purchases: 100 (2%)
- Revenue: 100 × $4.99 × 0.70 = **$349.30**

**Month 6:**
- Downloads: 15,000 (cumulative)
- Pro purchases: 300 (2%)
- Revenue: 300 × $4.99 × 0.70 = **$1,047.90**

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** $5,000 - $8,000 (conservative)

---

### ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS

**1. In-App Ads (Free Tier)**
